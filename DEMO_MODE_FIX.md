# Demo Mode State Management Fix

## Issue
When users choose demo mode and then sign out, demo data would persist in the application state until the page was reloaded. This happened because:

1. Demo data was stored in React component state across multiple hooks
2. The sign out process didn't properly clear demo state from all components
3. Only page reload would fully reset the application state

## Solution
We implemented a comprehensive demo mode state management system:

### 1. Enhanced AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Modified `signOut()` to properly exit demo mode before signing out
- Enhanced `exitDemoMode()` to clear all demo-related storage items
- Added custom event dispatching to notify all components when demo mode exits

### 2. Updated Hooks to Listen for Demo Mode Exit
Modified the following hooks to clear their state when demo mode exits:
- `usePortfolio` - Clears portfolio data and rebalancing recommendations
- `useSettings` - Clears user settings
- `usePiggyCore` - Resets all transaction, ledger, and holdings data

### 3. Event-Driven State Clearing
- Uses custom `demo-mode-exit` events to coordinate state clearing across components
- Each hook listens for this event and resets its state appropriately
- Ensures real user data loads properly after demo mode exit

### 4. Utility Hook (`src/hooks/use-demo-state.ts`)
Created a utility hook for future components that need demo mode state management.

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced demo mode exit logic
- `src/hooks/use-portfolio.ts` - Added demo exit state clearing
- `src/hooks/use-settings.ts` - Added demo exit state clearing  
- `src/hooks/use-piggy-core.ts` - Added demo exit state clearing
- `src/hooks/use-demo-state.ts` - New utility hook (created)

## Testing
After implementing this fix:
1. Enter demo mode - should see demo data
2. Sign out - demo data should immediately clear
3. Sign in with real account - should see real data without needing page reload
4. No stale demo data should persist in any component

## Storage Items Cleared
When exiting demo mode, the following items are cleared from both localStorage and sessionStorage:
- `demo_user_id`
- `demo_mode` 
- `mock_data_initialized`
- `piggy_state`
- `user_preferences`

IndexedDB demo cache is also cleared if it exists.

## Benefits
- Immediate state clearing without page reload required
- Proper separation between demo and real user data
- Better user experience when transitioning between demo and authenticated states
- Prevents data leakage between demo and real accounts
